          <p>
            <h4>
              The Main object of the PRIME KIDS CONTEST and the CELEBRITY KID
              CONTEST is to spotlight and showcase the African Kid as a kid with
              hope and a future. This is averse with what the media portrays and
              how the African Child is seen and perceived all over the world.
              The Charity Projects that take place after the Competition (Clothe
              and Feed a kid Campaign, Diaper Drive campaign) also expresses the
              desire of the organization to reach out to children in the inner
              cities of our beloved African continent. The Celebrity Kid
              Magazine, A Publication borne out of the need to showcase the
              African Child positively, had its premier edition published in
              February of 2022. Now with Two editions in print, the Magazine,
              not only showcases the artistry of Children, but their fashion
              sense and their robust ideas with a lot of beauty and colour;
              largely expressing that the African Child is truly a celebrity.{" "}
              <br />
              The Brand Ambassador Program which was affected in 2020 due to the
              sad global situation looks to pick up this year, 2022 and as an
              organization, we will be working with all the previous brand
              ambassadors and the new ones as well. <br />
              The projects, CAFAK (clothe and Feed a Kid) Campaign and Diaper
              Drive will be held in the localities of these brand ambassadors at
              different times in the coming year 2022.
